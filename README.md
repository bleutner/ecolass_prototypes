[ECoLaSS](https://www.ecolass.eu) is an EU Horizon2020 project to develop several prototypes of new or enhanced Copernicus Land services making full use of dense time series of SAR and optical Sentinel EO data. These prototypes shall be suggested for qualifying as candidates for operational integration into the future Copernicus Land Monitoring Service from 2020 onwards.

The Consortium performing the project is composed of five companies/institutions - lead by GAF AG (Germany) - with deep and complementary EO technical proficiency and wide experience in developing geo-spatial operational services in the land mapping domain to different users. In particular, it includes: SIRS (France), JOANNEUM RESEARCH (Austria), Universite Catholiqe De Louvain (Belgium), and the German Aerospace Center - DLR (Germany).
